Makers Academy student and physics graduate looking for a full time software development position. I am looking to begin my career in software development in an environment where I can learn quickly and where my passion for software design and programming is shared.

##Projects

__Alarming__: Social alarm and event organiser
Alarming is a mobile application allowing you to create and invite friends to events. The creator can invite users and set alarms on the invitees phones at a pre-set time using Cordova plugins. The invitees can then view an event and are able to see the events location and request directions using the google API. In order to update users in realtime of changes to the events and its attendees, we used Firebase for the backend of our application. This gave us the tools to use three way data binding in order to make our app run as smoothly as possible, without the need for our users to refresh the page.  https://github.com/chweeks/alarming

__RaveBot__: Party Playlist Creator and Manager
Built in a two day Hackathon RaveBot is a mobile application to crowd source a playlist at a party. Built with Ionic and AngularJS on the front end and Ruby on Rails on the backend, this app allows you to have one master device playing music while anyone with the party code can send songs along with messages from their own devices to be added into the playlist cycle; taking the hassle out of DJing a get together or party.

__Solar System Simulator__:
An application built in javascript and Jquery to simulate the orbital motion of planets around our sun. Uses Newton’s laws of gravitation in the backend with javascript  to simulate a circular orbit around our sun, varying with the target planet’s density and speed.

##Personal

I am an outgoing and professional individual currently seeking employment as a junior developer. My particular strengths include knowledge and understanding of both backend and frontend technologies including Ruby with frameworks like Rails and Sinatra, as well as Node.js. On the front end I am skilled with Javascript, Angular and building hybrid mobile apps with Ionic and Meteor.

I follow industry standard practises such as TDD, BDD and SOLID principles within my code, both as a means of driving development and ensuring mutable and maintainable code. I also enjoy pair programming and collaborating on projects with a team.

##Experience

Freelance Software Development – Full stack
Currently working with NetJets, the world’s largest private charter jet company, in order to create a dynamic safety and compliance iOS application for use by their pilots in order to improve both the quality of safety reporting as well as actual rates of submission. The main focus was to build an application as user friendly as possible to encourage quick and consistent reporting of safety issues. The finished product was built with an AngularJS and Ionic frontend that communicated with a Rails API backend; while a PSQL database housed the information submitted.
